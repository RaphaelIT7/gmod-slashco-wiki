<title>Cache Page</title>

# Cache
You've found the cache page :D<br>
This page is used by the wiki as the default fallback in case you tried to open a page while the wiki is down.<br>
<br>
Due to how the caching is set up you'll end up here first<br>
but you can then freely navigate using the side bar since all page jsons were cached locally when you first visited the wiki<br>
